\newcommand{\sectionbreak}{\clearpage}
{\color{black}
The traffic violations dataset contains the information about the traffic violations from all electronic traffic violations issued in the county of Montgomery.The data contains information about where the violation happened, the type of car, demographics on the person receiving the violation, and some other interesting information.


\begin{itemize}
	 \item The data is obtained from the source "https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/api/views/4mse-ku6q/rows.json"
    	 \item The dataset is obtained in terms of a JSON file.
    	 \item  A JSON file is short for JavaScript Object Notation and it is a way to store information in an organized manner and it is easy-to-access.
	 \item It helps in understanding the data in a logical manner. JSON feeds can be loaded asynchronously in a much easier manner with the JSON files than XML/RSS files. 
	 \item The data was first published on 18th September 2014.
    	 \item The data is updated on the daily basis.

\subsection{Explanation of the Code}
{\color{black}
Python has great JSON support, with the json library. We can both convert lists and dictionaries to JSON, and convert strings to lists and dictionaries. JSON data looks much like a dictionary would in Python, with keys and values stored.
\begin{itemize}
	\item First we read the json file using json package and urllib2 package and store it in json which is considered as a string.
	\item Then we extract the actual data which we need from json and store it as mdata.
    	\item  Now we select the columns we need from the data i.e. the useful columns we need and store them in a list called good\_columns.
	\item Now we iterate through mdata and extract the data corresponding to good\_columns and store it in a list called data. 
	\item Now that we have the data as a list of lists, and the column headers as a list, we can create a Pandas Dataframe to analyze the data.
   	\item If you\'re unfamiliar with Pandas, it\'s a data analysis library that uses an efficient, tabular data structure called a Dataframe to represent your data. Pandas allows you to convert a list of lists into a Dataframe and specify the column names separately.
    	\item The Pandas Dataframe created is stored as stops.
   	\item To perform time and location based analysis we need to convert the longitude, latitude and date columns from string to float.
  	\item The two seperate columns of time\_of\_stop and date\_of\_stop are converted into a single datetime column.
    	\item By using matplotlib.pyplot library we made a plot showing which days result in the most traffic stops.
    	\item We also made a plot showing teh most common traffict stop times in a particular day.
    	\item Now that we\'ve converted the location and date columns, we can map out the traffic stops. But we will have to filter down the rows we use from stops first.
    	\item Then we subset our data to past year.
    	\item We further narrowed it down by selecting the rows taht occured during the rush hours i.e. morning period when everyone is going to work and stored it as morning\_rush.
    	\item Now using the folium package we visulized the morning\_rush data by creating maps.
    	\item In order to preserve performance we only visualized teh first 1000 rows of morning\_rush.
    	\item We extended our analysis further by generating a heat map using folium package which shows the concentration of violation on the county map.
    
\end{itemize}

\section{Suggestions}
{\color{black}
In this code we learned how to use Python to go from a raw JSON data from a live source to fully functional maps using command line tools , Pandas, matplotlib, and folium.

This data can be used further for following analysis:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Variation of type of stop with location.
     	\item Correlation of income with number of stops.
     	\item Correlation of population density with number of stops.
     	\item Types of stops more common around midnight.

\end{itemize}
